# Matt Williams Code Samples

This is a repository for various samples of some of my most recent work over the last year+.  Most of this work has been completed utilizing client-side technologies like RequireJS, jQuery, AJAX with RactiveJS for front and back-end data binding, as well custom jQuery plugins and application code.

The repository is divided into PHP and JS samples by application, but due to the uncertain nature of corporate vs. individual code ownership, I cannot provide all of the server side interaction here for fear of repercussions.  That being said, I would be more than happy to explain any details of how the code works and/or thought process behind the code itself to answer any questions that may arise.

# Published Work
Most of my work at PERQ was put toward a promotions platform that allowed clients (mostly currently in the auto industry) to create customized promotion "microsites" that would run on the web, as well as on customized Microsoft Surface Pro tablet kiosks inside the dealerships.  Due to the nature of the platform, the links I provide here will be "testing" or "beta" links that are subject to change.  However, these should still allow for a solid idea of what this code was being used for.

## FATWIN.com - Instant Win Promotion Theme
#### Link: [http://fatwinbeta.com/huffine]
##### Folders: Root level folders in the `js/` directory, excluding `js/mail`
"Instant Win" promotion type.  90-98% of all HTML and CSS (outside of the stock Twitter Bootstrap v2.3.0 CSS) was written and/or customized by me.  90-95% of all of the JavaScript and jQuery running the promotion type was written by me as well.

This promotion type (along with all of FATWIN.com) utilizes RequireJS for AMD loading.  This promotion type, specifically, uses a custom data-binding and templating setup that uses RactiveJS at it's very foundation.  It also uses slightly customized version of AscensorJS to handle the full-screen, "panel" style navigation and flow of the promotion type.

## FATWIN.com - Mailpiece Promotion Theme
#### Link: Unfortunately, there is not a public link available. I am currently working on making a private link available.
##### Folders: `js/mail/` folder
"Mail/Mailpiece" promotion type.  At least 60-65% of the HTML was written by myself, specifically, adhering to the Twitter Bootstrap v3.0 standards and methods.  The at least 55-65% of all CSS (outside of the stock Twitter Bootstrap v3.0 CSS) was written and/or customized by me as well.

The promotion's client-side code structure utilizes RactiveJS for data binding with DirectorJS [http://github.com/flatiron/director] for client-side routing, and RequireJS for AMD loading.

## FATWIN.com - Server-side Data and Data Endpoints
##### Folders: `php/application`
This folder contains the code written to setup a loose MVC-inspired data backend to support our input-driven front-end promotions.  I, personally, am responsible for an estimated 35-45% of all of this code that was built using Paris ORM as a base [https://github.com/j4mie/paris].  The custom-written controllers were authored by Matthew Douglas [matthewdouglas@gmail.com], a coworker (and reference) of mine at PERQ.
Both this promotion and the Instant Win promotion type utilize many of the same data "endpoints".
