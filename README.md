Matt Williams Code Samples
============

This is a repository for various samples of some of my most recent work over the last year+.  Most of this work has been completed utilizing client-side technologies like RequireJS, jQuery, AJAX with RactiveJS for front and back-end data binding, as well custom jQuery plugins and application code.

The repository is divided into PHP and JS samples by application, but due to the uncertain nature of corporate vs. individual code ownership, I cannot provide all of the server side interaction here for fear of repercussions.  That being said, I would be more than happy to explain any details of how the code works and/or thought process behind the code itself to answer any questions that may arise.
